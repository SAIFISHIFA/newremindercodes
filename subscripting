        <P>For average stars like the Sun, the process of ejecting its outer layers
           continues until the stellar core is exposed. This dead, but still ferociously 
           hot stellar cinder is called a White Dwarf. White dwarfs, which are roughly the
           size of our Earth despite containing the mass of a star, once puzzled astronomers 
           - why didn't they collapse further? What force supported the mass of the core? 
            Quantum mechanics provided the explanation. Pressure from fast moving electrons
            keeps these stars from collapsing.</P>
