    <body>Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies.<br> 
        A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep within these
        clouds gives rise to knots</br> with sufficient mass that the gas and dust can begin to collapse 
        under its own gravitational attraction.<br> As the cloud collapses, the material at the center 
        begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing 
        cloud that will one day become a star.</br> Three-dimensional computer models of star formation
        predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three
        blobs; <br>this would explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way are paired or in
        groups of multiple stars.</br></body>
