        <p>Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects,
         as in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two
         or more stars. When two such stars have a relatively close orbit,
         their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution. 
         Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such 
         as a star cluster or a galaxy.</p>
