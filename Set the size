    <font><p>A star the size of our Sun requires about 50 million years to mature from the 
        beginning of the collapse to adulthood. Our Sun will stay in this mature phase
         (on the main sequence as shown in the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram) for approximately 
         10 billion years.</p></font>
